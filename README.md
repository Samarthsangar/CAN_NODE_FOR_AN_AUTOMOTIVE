# CAN_NODE_FOR_AN_AUTOMOTIVE
The goal of microcontroller CAN bus project is to implement CAN protocol based data exchange between two PIC based boards, which are acting as “nodes”. In this implementation automotive use-case is assumed by exchanging data like engine temperature, speed etc. that are displayed using LCD panels.
